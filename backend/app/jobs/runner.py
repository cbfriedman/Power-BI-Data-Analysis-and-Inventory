"""The scheduler boundary.

:class:`JobRunner` is the whole contract the application has with a
scheduler: register a callable on an interval or a cron expression, start,
shut down. :class:`APSchedulerRunner` is the one implementation — an
in-process APScheduler 3.x ``BackgroundScheduler``, no broker, no extra
service — and it must run in exactly one process (the worker or the single
API replica), or every replica fires every job.

Every job is registered with ``max_instances=1`` (a slow run is never
overlapped by the next tick), ``coalesce=True`` (missed ticks collapse into
one run rather than a burst), and ``misfire_grace_time=3600`` (a tick up to
an hour late still runs; later than that is skipped and the next tick
catches up).
